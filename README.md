Goals:
* Automation of order exporting system
  * Directly sent from website orders to master spreadsheet
* Up-to-date in real-time
* Shared with multiple people
* Edit the sheet
  * Support Cancellation or switch sections

Solutions:
* Keep website on Squarespace
* Shortcut for iPad to courses
* Allow for sign-ups when inventory is empty


Pain points with SquareSpace:
* Inventory management, especially related to year long versus single section sign-ups
* Seeing current class openings ahead of time
  * Parents that inquire about this to decide about sign-ups
  * Last minute sign-ups
  * Marketing / Advertising decisions (currently gets Squarespace notifications in emails, but overwhelmed with this)
*  Manual sign-ups (Potential cash payment, with form data)
